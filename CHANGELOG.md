# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This change log follows the conventions of [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com/).
Discljord follows semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New application command parameters in various endpoints regarding: localization, default-member-permission, dm-permission
- Endpoints for guild scheduled events
- Endpoints for guild templates
- New `cdn` functions for generating base64-encoded data uri images
- Every endpoint function can now log error responses at log level ERROR. This is enabled by default, but can be disabled for individual invocations using the new keyword arg `:log-error?` that is available for every endpoint function.

### Changed
- Tokens are now redacted in messaging trace logging
- Request parameters in messaging logging are now displayed in `prn-str` format for better readability
- Deprecated `batch-edit-application-command-permissions!` because it doesn't work anymore

### Fixed
- `edit-{global|guild}-application-command!` endpoints incorrectly expecting name and description as mandatory arguments
- `with-counts?` parameter in `get-invite!` -> `with-counts`
- Fix incorrect parsing behaviour by `parse-if-str` for leading 0s
- Keyword args in endpoint functions were declared incorrectly (`:keys [:a :b :c]` instead of `:keys [a b c]`). This had no semantic effect but has been corrected nonetheless.
- Fix missing implementation for `add-channel-pinned-message!`, delegate to new endpoints `pin-`/`unpin-message`
- Fix typo in `modify-guild-role!` endpoint name (`modifiy` -> `modify`)
- Fix typo in `start-thread-without-message!` which prevented it from working
- Fix [issue #108 - dependencies have slowly fallen out of date](https://github.com/discljord/discljord/issues/108)
