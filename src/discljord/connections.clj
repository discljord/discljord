  Acts like [[connect-bot!]], but also requires a gateway returned

  well as a function used to determine when identify payloads are permitted to
  be sent.

  `identify` must be a function from token to core.async channel which yields an
  item when an identify is permitted. This must be at least five seconds after
  the most recent identify by any shard, however any additional attempts to
  identify from this connection will include that wait by default, only
  identifies from other connections must be taken into account for this.

  The recommended number of shards for your bot can be determined by the return
  value of [[get-websocket-gateway]].

  If Discord determines the bot must re-shard, then a `:re-shard` event will be
  emitted from the returned channel and all shards will be disconnected.

  Because Discord has a limit of one shard connecting per five seconds, some
  amount of synchronization between calls to [[connect-shards!]] must be had.
  Additional calls should only be made five seconds after the
  `:connected-all-shards` event has been received."
